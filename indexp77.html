        <p>The Visual Studio integrated development environment is a creative launching pad that you can use to edit, debug, and build code, and then publish an app.
           An integrated development environment (IDE) is a feature-rich program that can be used for many aspects of software development. 
           Over and above the standard editor and debugger that most IDEs provide, Visual Studio includes compilers, code completion tools, graphical designers,
           and many more features to ease the software development process.

        <p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. 
           An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. 
           It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode. 
           The user can switch between the two using the Alt+↵ Enter key combination. 
           A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. 
           It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. 
           While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.
           You can use the shortcut Shift + ⌘ + J (on macOS) or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux). 
           The Browser console will open in a new window.
           Console programs communicate through text. 
           Many features are available in C#: Console.WriteLine renders a line of text. 
           Console.ReadLine gets user input.
